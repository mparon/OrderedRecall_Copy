                        You have been invited to take part in a research study being
                        conducted by the Computational Memory Lab at the University
                        of Pennsylvania. In this study, you will see or hear lists
                        of words, and later be asked to recall them. Full instructions
                        will be provided before the study, and you will be given the
                        opportunity to practice the task before the main phase of the
                        experiment begins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experiment will last approximately 30-50 minutes, not
                        counting breaks. The only minor risk of the study is fatigue
                        from completing the task. There will be opportunities to
                        rest between trials, in case you need to take a break at any
                        point. You will be given up to two and a half hours to
                        complete the study before the HIT expires. You must
                        participate throughout all trials of the experiment (i.e.,
                        answering all questions, making recalls when prompted) for
                        us to mark the HIT as complete. We will mark HITs as
                        complete within two business days.

                        Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may stop
                        the experiment at any time. If you have any questions about
                        your rights as a research participant, or about this study
                        in general, please contact the principal investigator:
